# v2.2.1 Release Notes

## Summary
This release focuses on improving the performance and stability of timer file processing. It also includes improvements to the release workflow.

## Changed
- **Performance:** `JSONLTimersManager` and `PlainTextTimersManager` now read timer files line-by-line. This significantly improves memory efficiency when handling very large timer files.
- The default polling interval for `checkTimers` in `JSONLTimersManager` and `PlainTextTimersManager` has been changed from `50ms` to `200ms` to reduce unnecessary load.
- **CI:** The release workflow has been improved to push Git tags before publishing to npm.

## Fixed
- Added error handling within the `checkTimers` callback to prevent the application from crashing if an error occurs during timer processing.
