# v2.2.0 Release Notes

## Summary
This release introduces a major refactoring of the library's core structure to provide a clearer and more explicit API. The single `TimersManager` has been replaced by two distinct classes, `JSONLTimersManager` and `PlainTextTimersManager`, based on the desired storage format. This change improves code organization and usability, but requires users to update their implementation.

## Breaking Changes
- **Class Restructure**: The generic `TimersManager` class has been removed and replaced by an abstract base class. Users must now explicitly choose which manager to instantiate:
    - `JSONLTimersManager`: For storing timers in the feature-rich **JSON Lines** format.
    - `PlainTextTimersManager`: For storing timers in the lightweight **plain-text** format.
- The previous behavior of automatically selecting the format based on the file extension is no longer supported.

## Migration Notes
To adapt to the new structure, update your code as follows:

**Before (v2.1.0):**
```javascript
import { TimersManager } from 'eternal-timer';

// Behavior depended on the file extension (e.g., .jsonl)
const manager = new TimersManager('path/to/.timers.jsonl'); 
```

**After (v2.2.0):**
```javascript
// For JSON Lines format
import { JSONLTimersManager } from 'eternal-timer';
const manager = new JSONLTimersManager('path/to/.timers.jsonl');

// For Plain Text format
import { PlainTextTimersManager } from 'eternal-timer';
const manager = new PlainTextTimersManager('path/to/.timers');
```

## Added
- Introduced `JSONLTimersManager` for handling timers in JSON Lines format.
- Introduced `PlainTextTimersManager` for handling timers in plain-text format.
- Added JSDoc comments to improve developer experience.
- Added `author` and `keywords` to `package.json`.
- Added optional dependency `@logtape/logtape` for enhanced internal logging.

## Changed
- The main entry point (`index.ts`) now exports the new manager classes.
- The overall architecture has been refactored into a more modular structure by splitting logic into multiple files (`TimersManager.ts`, `types.ts`, etc.).
- The `README.md` has been completely updated to reflect the new API, with clearer usage examples and documentation for each class.

## Fixed
- Corrected the GitHub Actions status badge URL in `README.md`.
- Various internal bug fixes were implemented during the refactoring process, improving stability and reliability.
