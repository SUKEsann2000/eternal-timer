# Release Notes for v2.0.4

## Summary

This release introduces a key feature to the `checkTimers` method, which now returns an interval object, allowing for the cancellation of timer monitoring. It also includes several internal refactorings to improve performance and maintainability, such as adopting asynchronous file operations and streamlining file existence checks.

## Changes

### ✨ Features

-   The `checkTimers` method now returns a `NodeJS.Timeout` interval object. This allows you to stop the timer checks using `clearInterval()`, providing more control over the timer monitoring process.

### ♻️ Refactoring

-   Switched from synchronous `fs.readFileSync` to asynchronous `fs.promises.readFile` in `removeTimer` and `showTimers` to improve performance by not blocking the event loop.
-   The logic for creating the timer file (`.timers`) has been simplified. It now uses a synchronous check (`fs.accessSync`/`fs.writeFileSync`) in the `TimersManager` constructor, ensuring the file exists before any operations are performed.
-   The private `createFile` method has been removed as it is no longer needed.
-   The `checkTimerfileSyntax` function has been moved outside the `TimersManager` class to be a standalone utility function.

### 📖 Documentation

-   Added GitHub Actions status and NPM download count badges to `README.md`.
-   Updated the documentation and examples for `checkTimers` in `README.md` to reflect the new return value.
